Iris Flower Classification Project

A comprehensive machine learning project implementing multiple classification algorithms to predict iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor 
- Iris Virginica

The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, model implementation, and performance comparison across 7 different algorithms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement and compare multiple machine learning classification algorithms
- Analyze the famous Iris dataset through exploratory data analysis
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics
- Identify the best-performing algorithm for this classification task

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the classic Iris dataset, which contains:
- 150 samples of iris flowers
- 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- 3 classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, Iris Virginica
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
